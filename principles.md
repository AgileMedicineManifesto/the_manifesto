# The Principles of Agile Medicine

We follow these principles:

Our highest priority is the health of the patient through preventive measures as well as early and continuous delivery of effective healthcare treatment, which sometimes means no intervention. 

A person’s health and well-being will be our primary measure of progress. Effective measures as well as untoward complications will be declared publicly and openly discussed to help promote change for the good. We will promote the use of standardized mortality ratios for evaluating the quality of care. We will strive for perfection while emphasizing that healthcare is not perfect anywhere, and that the open reporting of problems will help us to find ways to prevent the problems in the future.

Simplicity – the art of finding the optimal balance between when to treat and when not to treat – is essential. The corollary is that we must strive to measure the effects of treatment and no treatment.

We will strive to promote the development of sustainable improvements in healthcare delivery. 

We welcome new data and new perspectives, even when they might contradict our current way of thinking. Agile processes are adaptive to change when change is for the better and recognizing that change for the better is essential to effective health care. The anti-pattern is change for change’s sake. The adoption of change ideally should occur based on validated scientific evidence, or at the least via improvement science with a goal to create generalizable knowledge. The corollary to this is that random improvement/changes should be pooled to share knowledge. 

We will strive to provide systems of care for patients based on the participation of highly motivated individuals, and to give them the environment, support and trust they need to get the job done. The corollary to this is that improvement of systems must be founded on patient safety first, then quality improvement. Systems change without these in place is dangerous.

The best solutions to unique problems emerge from self-organizing agile team. The corollary to this is for the teams first to be empowered to decide upon their own goals, and then to develop ways to achieve these. An anti-pattern is that not every problem is unique.

Where possible, variation in treatment of patients with the same condition should be standardized with variation existing because of patient preference or unique patient characteristics requiring an individualized approach.

Even standardized, diagnostic and therapeutic pathways will need to change with time, and self-organizing teams, aware of the outcomes and the why’s of the pathways, will be in the best position to know when change is needed.

The tools available to the team should be readily adaptable by the team. An anti-pattern would be providing tools that are “best in class” at a point in time, but not modifiable by members of agile teams, which although resulting in short term gains, would limit future agility.

At regular intervals, the self-organizing teams will reflect on how to become more effective, and then tune and adjust their behavior through measurable processes and outcomes. The corollary to this is that measurement is a core part of our work. The anti-pattern is that not everything needs to be measured, and not everything that is measured matters.

Agile teams know that additional resources are required to test new methods and pathways, but that the best pathways emerge when these are scaled to all who have this need. Designing systems of care that offer better pathways to patients who have the same needs but different resources undermines the core values of the system and destroys self motivated teams. Care pathways that provide different care to people with different resources should always be considered incomplete.

Continual attention to technical excellence and good design enhance agility. Those who develop technical systems should wherever possible work side by side in the agile teams since their products form part of the caring relationship.

Core to effective team work is effective, efficient, open communication. When initiating communication, we will think of our needs, the receiver’s needs, and the organization’s needs as we choose the best modality for the best care of the person. Communication technology should enhance, not replace, the caring relationship.  We recognize that what was said or sent is not always the same as what is understood or acted upon. Wherever possible communication should allow for dialog and conversation.
