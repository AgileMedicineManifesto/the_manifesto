# The Manifesto for the Agile Practice of Medicine

## Rationale

Whereas the medical profession's highest purposes are to heal the sick, ameliorate suffering and help everyone realize the best possible health and well-being, we recognize that the practice of medicine has become too strongly influenced by incentives, processes and technologies that focus on the administrative aspects of health care services rather than on the care of the patient.

Clinicians, inclusive of physicians, nurses, other health care professionals have a responsibility to improve upon the organization and provision of patient care. Insofar as possible, clinicians should create, design, and advocate for systems and processes that support the highest purposes of medicine.

## Statement of Values

We therefore declare with this manifesto that we will dedicate ourselves to achieving the highest purposes of medicine. In accordance with the principles of our manifesto, we will seek and implement approaches to the practice of medicine with open collaborative tools and knowledge sharing, and we will help, and welcome, others to join us in our commitment.

We believe that healthcare is a fundamental human right, and that we have a responsibility to care for all.

We value

* Caring and health as more important than healthcare itself
* Patients and their families as the core and the focus of the collaborative care team
* Continual care over episodic care
* Communication over documentation
* Systems of care that are self-reinforcing and continually learning over regulation
* Embracing change and continual improvement
* Open meaningful measures over closed external measures
